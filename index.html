                Hi, I’m Aarya Ravishankar, 
                a sophomore at the University of Texas at Dallas, pursuing a degree in Computer Science. 
                I’m passionate about leveraging technology to solve real-world problems, with a strong focus on 
                software development, data analysis, and artificial intelligence.

                With hands-on experience in various programming languages like Python, Java, JavaScript and C++ 
                I’ve developed projects ranging from educational applications to inventory management systems.

                What drives me is the constant pursuit of learning—whether it’s exploring new AI techniques,
                enhancing my skills in big data, or diving into bioinformatics research. My goal is to merge my passion for computer 
                science with my interest in cutting-edge technologies to create impactful solutions.

                When I’m not coding, you can find me exploring new research ideas, working on side projects, 
                or staying active in student organizations. I thrive in collaborative environments and am always open to new challenges.
